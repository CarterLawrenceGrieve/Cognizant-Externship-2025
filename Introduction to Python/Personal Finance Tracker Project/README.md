This is a very simple personal finance tracker, capable of organizing expenses under categories, reproducing those expenses, and summing costs over each category.

It uses a dictionary, with expense category acting as a key that houses lists of tuples of the form (description, cost).

Limited input validation is performed to catch simple user errors.
