This small program uses the Zephyr LLM hosted directly on huggingface's website.

To run this code, you will need:
    -huggingface's hub module (pip install huggingface_hub)
    -a huggingface API token with access to interface LLM calls

The Zephyr model (as of 6/13/25) is free, and thus this code does not require anything outside a huggingface developer account.
